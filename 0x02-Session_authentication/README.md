# Session Authentication Project

## Background Context
In this project, you will implement a **Session Authentication** system from scratch. You are not allowed to install any external modules.

> **Note:** In the industry, you should not implement your own session authentication system. Instead, use a module or framework that handles it, such as `Flask-HTTPAuth` in Python-Flask. However, for learning purposes, we will build each step of this mechanism to understand how it works by doing.

## Resources
Read or watch:
- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms](https://www.example.com) - Only the session auth part
- [HTTP Cookie](https://www.example.com)
- [Flask](https://www.example.com)
- [Flask Cookie](https://www.example.com)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What **authentication** means
- What **session authentication** means
- What **Cookies** are
- How to **send Cookies**
- How to **parse Cookies**

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **Python 3** (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a **new line**.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is **mandatory**.
- Your code should use the **pycodestyle** style (version 2.5).
- All your files must be **executable**.
- The length of your files will be tested using **wc**.
- All your modules should have **documentation** (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your classes should have **documentation** (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have **documentation**:
  - `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
  - `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
- A documentation is not a simple word; it should be a **real sentence** explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
